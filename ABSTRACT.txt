Kubernetes clusters increasingly host applications that manipulate data in
persistent storage.  Preserving that data is important but how does it get
there in the first place?  Unless it can generate its own data, the application
should expect the volume to be populated prior to initialization.  This may
seem like a trivial problem with many simple solutions but we can build on
kubernetes design principles to produce a superior solution.  In this session
you will discover a declarative PV population pattern, observe some concrete
examples how this can be applied to different sources of data, learn about some
common problems in this area and how kubernetes can help to solve them.  After
the session you will be ready to contribute your own populator to the
kubernetes community.
